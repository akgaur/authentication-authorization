This repository will focus on the implementation of all the type of authentication that exists.
- As of now below mentioned type of authentication will be implemented.

## Password-based authentication:
Users are required to enter a username and a secret password. This is one of the most common forms of authentication.

## Biometric authentication:
This involves using unique physical or behavioral characteristics of an individual, such as fingerprints, retinal patterns, facial recognition, or voice recognition.

## Multi-factor authentication (MFA): 
This combines two or more different types of authentication methods. For example, a combination of a password, a fingerprint scan, or a security token.

## Token-based authentication:
Users are given a physical or virtual token that generates a one-time password. This password is used in addition to a regular password for authentication.

## Smart card authentication:
Users are required to insert a smart card into a card reader, which contains authentication information.

## Certificate-based authentication: 
This involves the use of digital certificates to verify the identity of users or systems. Public key infrastructure (PKI) is often used for certificate-based authentication.

## OAuth (Open Authorization): 
A protocol that allows users to log in and share information without sharing their credentials. It is commonly used for third-party application authorization.

## Single Sign-On (SSO):
Users authenticate once and gain access to multiple systems or applications without needing to log in again for each one.

## Risk-based authentication:
Authentication decisions are based on the perceived risk level. For example, if a user is trying to log in from a new location or device, additional authentication steps may be required.

## Time-based authentication:
Access is granted only during specific time periods or within a certain timeframe.
